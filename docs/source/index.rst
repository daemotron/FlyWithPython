FlyWithPython Documentation
===========================

This documentation covers both, usage and development of FlyWithPython. Please
read the appropriate sections carefully before raising an issue or ask for
support otherwise - there's a good chance your question might be answered by the
information provided through this documentation. Please note that though related
this documentation does not cover general `X-Plane`_ end user guidance.

.. note::

   This documentation is perpetually updated from the project's central
   :ref:`git repository's <blessed-repository>` master branch. To ensure you
   work with the latest version available, please make sure to access this
   documentation exclusively at https://flywithpython.readthedocs.io/


How the documentation is organised
----------------------------------

* If you're an X-Plane user, wishing to use FlyWithPython, try the
  :doc:`User's Guide <user/index>`.

* The :doc:`Project Documentation <internals/index>` will tell you about the
  development process, and how you can contribute.

* :doc:`Reference guides <ref/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and
  other aspects of the FlyWithPython machinery. They describe how it works and
  how to use it but assume that you have a sound understanding of programming
  concepts and profound `Python`_ knowledge.
